Ok, I am a beginner and I want to learn programming so when I asked someone how should I proceed to touch my goal, he said slowly and with the basics steps: first learn HTML, then you'll see.


Ok I have an account on http://www.codecademy.com and, I chosed HTML as learning language and next step the site splitted the view in 2 halves first half is for code, second for preview.

At one exercises it says:

"This program should toggle the dropdown menu when Flipboard is clicked. However, the program has four mistakes that prevent it from working. Find and fix these bugs to get the dropdown menu working again."

and in code window is typed:

var main = function() {
  $(".dropdown-toggle").click function() { 
  	$(".dropdown-menu").toggle();
  });
}

$(document).ready(main);
